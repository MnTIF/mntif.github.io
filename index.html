                    <h1>About the M&T Innovation Fund</h1>
                    <p>The <strong>M&T Innovation Fund</strong> is a new, University and M&T Program backed student run organization looking to provide non-equity grants for seed-stage ventures started by current Penn students or recent M&T alumni. Grants will range from <strong>$1000 to $5000.</strong></p>
                    <p>The Fund is managed and operated by current M&T students from all class years. Faculty advisers, M&T Program administration, and M&T alumni act as support for the Fund. Current students work for either the <strong>Investment team</strong> or the <strong>Value Creation team.</strong></p>
                    <p>The <strong>Investment team</strong> sources ventures, conducts due diligence, and makes the final investment decisions. A rigorous evaluation process allows the Fund to target high quality, technical ventures.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>Value Creation team</strong> acts as consultants for each backed venture. The Value Creation team provides insights into evaluating new markets, growing customer bases, developing and commercializing technologies, and connecting teams with mentors, legal advisors, and additional funding. </p>

                        <h1>The M&T Innovation Fund Difference</h1>
                        <p>The M&T Innovation Fund differentiates itself as a unique provider of both financial and strategic support for the ventures it selects. Receiving a grant from the Fund will provide initial capital that can help get seed stage ventures closer to their goals. Perhaps more importantly, chosen startups can leverage the varied experiences and insights of current students, who will provide critical strategic insights into bringing a product to market. These companies can also gain valuable connections and mentorship from successful M&T alumni to further their venture.
