                    <h1>About the M&T Innovation Fund</h1>
                    <p>The <strong>M&T Innovation Fund</strong> is a University- and M&T-backed student run organization looking to provide value creation for seed-stage ventures. Along with value creation tasks, non-equity grants will be provided for specific expenses.
                    </strong></p>
                    <p>The Fund is managed and operated by current M&T students from all class years. Faculty advisers, M&T Program administration, and M&T alumni act as support for the Fund.</p>
                    <p>The Fund is similar to an incubator or accelerator. Candidate ventures should be as interested in venture development as they are in the non-equity grants. Grants will likely fall between $1000~5000.</p>
                    <p>The Fund will only give out grant money for expenses that are 1) specific, 2) near-term, and 3) related to the venture development in which the Fund is involved. That is, the Fund is not interested in handing out non-equity grants for "black box" expenses, or for expenses a venture anticipates having in a year's time.</p>

                        <p>The M&T Innovation Fund differentiates itself as a unique provider of both financial and strategic support for the ventures it selects. Grants from the Fund will provide initial capital that help seed stage ventures achieve particular goals. Perhaps more importantly, the fund will continue to be of support to the ventures we fund. Chosen startups can leverage the varied experiences and insights of current M&T students, who will provide critical strategic insights into bringing a product to market. These companies can also gain valuable connections and mentorship from successful M&T alumni to further their venture.

                                    The fund’s objective is to provide continued support over the semester to develop a component of your project while working with M&T students. For example, you may end up working closely with our team to help you develop a marketing plan or to provide technical consulting with the advancement of a software product. For the M&T Innovation Fund to be right fit for you must be interested in a project based funding approach rather than an unconditional grant.

He is particularly interested in developing information-centric network architectures that can be easily extended, composed, and formally verified. His recent projects include applying declarative networking techniques in the areas of dynamic network composition, adaptive mobile ad-hoc networks, and scalable knowledge-based networks. He is also exploring novel database-inspired techniques for diagnosing, securing, and verifying network protocols.</p>
